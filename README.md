## Minecraft stronghold calculator

## !! NOTICE THIS IS NOT ALLOWED BY SPEEDRUN.COM !!

This is a tool to find the position of the Minecraft stronghold using only 2 precisely measured eye throws. I plan to have 2 versions. A manual mode, where you have to manually paste in the result of f3+c or the result in the format x z a. And an automatic mode where it just does everything for you (not done yet)

HOW TO USE
==========

Just throw an eye, and then turn your FOV and sensitivity down all the way, and line up your crosshair so the right of it is aligned with the left of the middle pixel of the eye. Then, press f3 + c and paste the result in the text box. After that, go to the left or right ~20 blocks (the further you travel the more accurate it is) and repeat the steps. This works better if you line yourself up by getting in a boat and then getting out of it (called boat eye)

## Building
If you are using the Pyinstaller module, just ```cd``` into the directory and then run
```
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "Triangulator Manual.ui:." Triangulatinator\ -\ Manual.pyw
```

This is just a fun project of mine, so it won't be very good.
